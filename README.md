# mini-java

A MiniJava compiler implemented in Clojure. This was a semester-long project
for the Fall 2014 section of CSC444 at SUNY Oswego. Any MiniJava program
according to the
[grammar specification](
  http://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/MCIIJ2e/grammar.htm)
given by Cambridge University can be compiled down to JVM bytecode. In addition
to the Cambridge grammar, my own personal addition to the language -- a recur
statement -- is correctly parsed and compiled.


## Running

To run from the JAR, simply download the JAR from the final release, and
run with `java -jar mini-javac.jar --help`.

To build from source, first ensure that Leiningen 2.0 is installed and on your
classpath, then run as follows:

```bash
$ lein antlr4
$ lein uberjar
$ java -jar target/mini-javac.jar --help
Usage: mini-javac [options] filename

Options:
  -d, --directory DIR     .  Destination directory for class files
      --syntax               Stop after syntax checking
      --static-semantics     Stop after static semantics checking
  -h, --help
```

Sample MiniJava programs are provided in the `samples/` directory.
Run the `sample-run.sh` bash script to compile and run all samples.


## Implementation

Source code parsing is accomplished using [ANTLR4](http://www.antlr.org/) to
create an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), according
to the grammar specified in `src/antlr/MiniJava.g4`. Useful messages are
output in the event of parse errors, indicating the location of the error and
providing some insight into the possible cause, much like `javac`.
A correctly parsed AST is then transformed into a more desirable form using the
functions in the `mini-java.ast` namespace.

Static semantics (type checking and name resolution) was performed on the
AST using functions I wrote in the `mini-java.static-semantics` namespace.
This ensures that no errors beyond mere syntax errors survived until
compilation time. 

After static semantics checking succeeds, the AST is transformed once again,
in the `mini-java.code-gen` namespace, this time into valid JVM bytecode.
This process was aided by the use of the robust [ASM 5](http://asm.ow2.org/)
library. Valid Java `.class` files are output at the end of this process,
which can be run using `java`. This has been tested on OpenJDK 1.7.0, but
in theory it should work on any standard Java implementation starting with
JDK 1.1.0.


## Language Feature Addition

As part of the project, we were required to choose one addition to make to the
language. I chose to make a `recur` statement for handling tail recursion. The
statement resembles the ternary operator from C-family languages, but uses
it in a very different way. An example usage of the statement is given in the
factorial program below:

```java
public int factorial(int n) {
    return this.factorial_iter(n, 1);
}

public int factorial_iter(int n, int result) {
    recur 0 < n ? (n-1, n*result) : result;
}
```

The statement is broken up into 3 parts. The first is the predicate, `0 < n`,
which determines which of the two following parts are to be evaluated.
If the predicate is true, the recursive case is evaluated, `(n-1, n*result)`,
and the method recurs with the given bindings. If the predicate is false, the
base case is evaluated, `result`, and returned. Since MiniJava only allows
return statements at the end of a method, this made it simple to implement
tail call optimization. As a result, any use of the `recur` statement is
automatically tail call optimized.

Special thanks goes to Dr. Doug Lea, the instructor who helped make this
possible. I'd also like to thank Terence Parr for developing the ANTLR parsing
tool which I wouldn't have survived without, the folks from the ObjectWeb
consortium for developing ASM which made bytecode generation a breeze, and the
Clojure community for creating the language which made writing this compiler a
joy.
